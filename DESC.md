Claude Code Runner is a Python-based CLI automation tool that streamlines the process of opening multiple Claude Code sessions across subdirectories in a development workspace. The tool automatically scans a given directory, launches a new terminal window for each subdirectory, and initiates Claude Code with project-specific instructions, supporting both new session creation and existing session resumption. It features three progressive versions (basic, enhanced with pexpect, and stage-aware), cross-platform support for Linux/WSL and macOS, and implements a sophisticated 14-stage development workflow system that guides projects from initial planning through deployment and maintenance. The architecture employs platform abstraction for terminal management, supports parallel execution, and uses an instruction file hierarchy to inject context-appropriate prompts into Claude Code sessions, making it particularly useful for managing complex multi-project development environments where consistent AI-assisted development practices are needed.
